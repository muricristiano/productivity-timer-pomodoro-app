# Productivity Timer App
This repository contains the code for a Productivity Timer web application built with React and TypeScript.

## Technologies Used

### React
React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a component-based architecture that allows developers to create reusable UI components and efficiently manage application state.

### TypeScript
TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds static typing to the language. It helps catch type-related errors early in the development process and improves code maintainability and readability.

### Context API
Context API is a feature provided by React for managing global state in a React application. It allows data to be passed through the component tree without the need to explicitly pass props at every level.

### localStorage 
localStorage is a web browser feature that enables web applications to store key-value pairs locally on a user's device. It is useful for persisting user preferences and settings across sessions in web applications.

## Libraries

### Styled Components
Styled Components is a library that enables writing CSS code directly within JavaScript or TypeScript files. It offers a convenient and efficient way to style React components with scoped styles.

### RHF (React Hook Form)
RHF is a library for managing form state and validation in React applications. It simplifies form handling and validation processes, making it easier to create robust and user-friendly forms.

### React Router DOM
React Router DOM is a library that facilitates client-side routing in React applications. It allows developers to create dynamic, single-page applications with multiple views or pages. With React Router DOM, you can define routes, link to different parts of your application, and handle navigation seamlessly within your React components. This technology enhances the user experience by enabling smooth transitions between different views while maintaining a single-page application architecture.

### Productivity Timer App - Pomodoro
